            I'm a full stack developer, having worked on applications using different languagues like <strong>
            JavaScript</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>, using technologies like <strong>Express.js</strong>, <strong>
            React</strong>, <strong>Firebase</strong>, <strong>Unity</strong> and <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>.

        <h2>The Pixel</h2>
        <p>
            When I was in school, I wanted to create videogames and enter the industry. In 2016 my first complete game was <strong>
            The Pixel</strong>, a simple mobile arcade game where pixels start to attack you and you have to use touch controls to destroy them.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's my first completed game I made, with a full gameplay loop, a local high score system and a customizable pixel.
        </p>

        <p>
            The code was kinda rough on the edges, and probably it had a lot of spaghettification, so I decided to learn
            how to make a game from some other place rather than YouTube tutorials.

        <h2>Simius Labs</h2>
        <p>
            I started studying a <b>videogame development degree</b> at the <b>Mendoza University</b> and
            along with some classmates we formed <b>Simius Labs</b>, to start making games. We made a 2D platformer on mobile
            called <b>Hammerdwarf</b>, where we control a dwarf that can't jump but uses his hammer to go though the level
            using different mechanics.

        <h2>Mimic Games</h2>
        <p>
            During my studies, I worked at Mimic Games, learning how to program in a team, how to use git and many programming patterns.

        <h2>Urban Explorers</h2>
        <p>
            Later, I joined with some classmates and friends to start a game about urban exploration, with the mechanics focusing
            on the lighting as a resource.

        <p>
            I started leading the programming team and using some TDD programming to ensure functionality. Some stuff I made was:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inventory system</li>
            <li>Command console</li>
            <li>Postprocessing effects</li>
        </ul>

            Here are some tests I made for active ragdolls, notice how the ragdoll still looks "alive" and uses their arms
            and legs to cover before impact.
